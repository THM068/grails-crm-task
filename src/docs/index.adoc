== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Task Management Plugin

A *Task* in {gr8crm} is a domain instance that represents a unit of work that has been done in the past or is scheduled to be done in the future.
A task is very similar to a calendar item, it has a start time and a duration.
Because tasks are so generic and flexible, {gr8crm} applications can use tasks in many ways. Here's are a list of real-world use-cases for tasks.

- Calendar items
- Scheduled meetings, with list of attenders
- Conference or training registration
- Telemarketing call items
- Alarms on important dates
- Time reporting
- Event logging

== Domain model

In the center of the domain model is the +CrmTask+ domain class. It has a reference to +CrmTaskType+ that specifies
what type of task it is (phone call, meeting, training, work item, etc.)
A task also has a many-relation to +CrmTaskAttender+. This collection is used when you want to specify attenders on the task.
The +CrmTaskAttender+ domain class has a reference to +CrmContact+ that represents the attender. This is the main reason why this
plugin have a compile-time dependency on the +crm-contact+ plugin.

== CrmTaskService

The +CrmTaskService+ provides methods for task management.

=== Create a task

To create a new task you use +crmTaskService.createTask(Map values, boolean save)+. The only mandatory properties in +CrmTask+ are +name+, +type+, +startTime+ and +endTime+.
Name is title of the task and type specifies the task type. Start time and end time can be set in a few different ways,
the most common way is to set them both to +Date+ instances. Another option is to set +startTime+ and +duration+ in minutes.
Setting the transient property +duration+ will set +endTime+ automatically.
